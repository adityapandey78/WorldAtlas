# Country Details App

This is a **React-based web application** that dynamically fetches and displays detailed information about countries. The app is built with a focus on **dynamic routing**, **state management**, and **responsive UI design**. It demonstrates the use of modern React concepts and libraries to create a scalable and user-friendly application.

---

## Features🌟

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented using React Router, including dynamic routes like `/country/:id` to display country-specific details.
- **API Integration**: Used Axios to fetch real-time data about countries from an external API.
- **Responsive Design**: A modern and fully responsive UI that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Loading State Management**: Displayed a loader using the `useTransition` hook to ensure smooth transitions during data fetching.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components like `CountryDetails`, `Loader`, and `AppLayout` for better scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used👨‍💻

### React
- Built the application using React's component-based architecture.
- Managed state and side effects using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

### React Router
- Implemented routing for navigation between pages.
- Used dynamic routing (`/country/:id`) to fetch and display country-specific details.

### Axios
- Handled API requests to fetch country data dynamically.

### React Hooks
- **`useState`**: Managed the state of country details and handled updates dynamically.
- **`useEffect`**: Fetched data when the component mounted.
- **`useParams`**: Extracted dynamic parameters from the URL for fetching country-specific data.
- **`useTransition`**: Ensured smooth transitions and kept the UI responsive during data fetching.

### CSS
- Designed a modern and responsive UI using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.
- Added animations and gradients to enhance the visual appeal.
